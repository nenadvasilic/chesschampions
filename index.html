      <h1 class="text-center mt-5 mb-4">Chess</h1>
      <p class="h6">
        Chess is a board game played between two players. The current form of
        the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th
        century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin.
        Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by
        millions of people worldwide. There are related games such as xiangqi.
      </p>
      <p class="h6">
        Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information.
        It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an
        eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player (one controlling the
        white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen
        pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and
        eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king,
        whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no
        way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a
        draw.
      </p>
      <p class="h6">
        Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is
        governed internationally by FIDE (International Chess Federation). The
        first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz,
        claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion.
        A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception.
        Aspects of art are found in chess composition; and chess in its turn
        influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields
        such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology.
      </p>
      <p class="h6">
        One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a
        chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to
        beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry
        Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best
        human players, and have deeply influenced the development of chess
        theory.

                <strong>Robert James Fischer</strong> (March 9, 1943 – January

                World Chess Champion. A chess prodigy, at age 14 he won the 1958
                U.S. Championship. In 1964, he won the same tournament with a
                perfect score (11 wins). Qualifying for the 1972 World
                Championship, Fischer swept matches with Mark Taimanov and Bent
                Larsen by 6-0 scores. After another qualifying match against
                Tigran Petrosian, Fischer won the title match against Boris
                Spassky of the USSR, in Reykjavík, Iceland. Publicized as a Cold
                War confrontation between the US and USSR, the match attracted
                more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or
                since.

                <strong>Garry Kimovich Kasparov</strong> (Russian: Гарри Кимович
                Каспаров, Russian pronunciation: [ˈɡarʲɪ ˈkʲiməvʲɪtɕ kɐˈsparəf],
                born Garik Kimovich Weinstein, Гарик Кимович Вайнштейн; 13 April
                1963) is a Russian chess grandmaster, former World Chess
                Champion, writer, political activist and commentator. From 1984
                until his retirement in 2005, Kasparov was ranked world No. 1
                for a record 255 months overall for his career. His peak rating
                of 2851,[1] achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until
                being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. Kasparov also holds
                records for the most consecutive professional tournament
                victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11).

      <p class="h6">
        In 1993, World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Nigel Short
        split from FIDE, and played their title match under the auspices of the
        Professional Chess Association. In response, FIDE stripped Kasparov of
        his title and arranged its own World Championship match between former
        champion Anatoly Karpov and Candidates finalist Jan Timman. For the next
        13 years there were two rival world titles.
